## report: difference in energy conservation

As sun mass >> earth/mars mass,
all gravitational effets are dominated by
the sun. Thus for earth, mars' effect
becomes negligible. For mars, earth's effect
becomes negligible. To good approximation,
earth maintains a uniform circular motion;
the same applies to mars.

Therefore theoretically, we expect KE and PE
remain fairly constant, with slight sinusoidal
variations when planets revolve in circles.
In a program, errors can accumulate,
leading to variation in energies.

For Euler method, there exists a large drop in
both KE and PE. That is because Euler method is
a first order scheme, so over iterations,
errors accumulate to become large.
Over 4 earth periods (400 code steps),
errors are nearly 0.2 (~10^-1).

For predictor-corrector method, the drop in
energies is comparatively lower. That is because
while Euler method is used to predict,
there is a corrector method to modify and tune.
Thus it outperforms Euler method. Over 4 periods,
errors are nearly 10^-5, which is 4-5 order
better than Euler method.

Note: look at the 4,5-th columns of the csv files
for KE,PE errors.
